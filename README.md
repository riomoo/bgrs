## FAQ
**Is +BGRS compatible with (A)GPL?**  
Inclusion of additional legal notices is allowed under ยง7(b) of the (A)GPL assuming they do not infringe on any of the freedoms granted to the user by the license.

**Is +BGRS compatible with ANY license?**  
So long as they don't contradict or undermine +BGRS portion of the license and vice versa.

**How can I enforce people using characters correctly?**  
You can't, the hope is this license creates consistency in characters that are shared across games and stories.

**When is it acceptable to use this License?**  
Primarily when you need a license for Board games, RPGs, or Stories. It's compatible with anything like this, including Video Game RPGs, Standalone Stories, Websites with Stories or Board Games, etc. If you have software used for the frontend or backend, it's advised to use another license in conjunction with this one. If it's just story text, rule text, markdown text, and no software code? The +BGRS License alone is enough.
