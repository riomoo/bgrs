## About
The +BGRS (Board Game/RPG/Story, pronounced "Burgers" or "Plus Burgers") License aims to provide a license specifically for content used in board games, RPGs, and stories. It allows users to modify, adapt, and use the content for these purposes, while primarily seeking to ensure the integrity of the characters and their representations.

## Why?
There exists no license only existing for Board Games, RPGs, and/or Stories. This license seeks to resolve that by being both a standalone and additional license.

## How?
Two ways:
If this LICENSE will be used as a standalone:
```
Copyright (c) year owner.
All rights reserved.

This +BGRS License grants permission to modify, adapt,
and use the content for board games, RPGs, and stories:
- All adaptations must maintain the integrity of the characters and their
  representations (feats, personality, and status), even when used
  in other properties.
- You must credit the original creator when using or adapting the content.
- This license must be included in any project that borrows from this
  content directly and you agree to the terms of this license.

You may also apply or combine with additional licenses, resulting in
a new license format: "any license+BGRS" as long as they do not conflict with this
license and only the bullet points above are required to add to the combined license.
Content is provided "as is", without warranty.
For more information, visit: <https://bgrs.jester-designs.com>
```
Or include the following text in any compatible LICENSE such as MIT/AGPL/BSD-4-Clause:
```
- All adaptations must maintain the integrity of the characters and their
  representations (feats, personality, and status), even when used
  in other properties.
- You must credit the original creator when using or adapting the content.
- This license must be included in any project that borrows from this
  content directly and you agree to the terms of this license.
```
Which would change the license name format into any of the following licenses:

## FAQ
**Is +BGRS compatible with (A)GPL?**  
Inclusion of additional legal notices is allowed under ยง7(b) of the (A)GPL assuming they do not infringe on any of the freedoms granted to the user by the license.

**Is +BGRS compatible with ANY license?**  
So long as they don't contradict or undermine +BGRS portion of the license and vice versa.

**How can I enforce people using characters correctly?**  
You can't, the hope is this license creates consistency in characters that are shared across games and stories.

**When is it acceptable to use this License?**  
Primarily when you need a license for Board games, RPGs, or Stories. It's compatible with anything like this, including Video Game RPGs, Standalone Stories, Websites with Stories or Board Games, etc. If you have software used for the frontend or backend, it's advised to use another license in conjunction with this one. If it's just story text, rule text, markdown text, and no software code? The +BGRS License alone is enough.
